The order of notebooks goes as follows: DataProjectSetup, then PlottingData.

Please Note* It is recommended to not run DataProjectSetup again if desired results much match the analysis given in plots for Data Summary and Presentation. Please take into consideration that the Package needed for requests takes current data, and thus can change the NBA_Data.csv and NCAA_Data.csv files as more games are played for players down the line. If the exact plots are needed from analysis, please run only PlottingData to generate plots stored in ProjectPlots.

*Analysis for plots and data can be found in Data Summary
